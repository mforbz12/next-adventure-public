# next-adventure

This is an app that tracks and stores various travel recommendations. The user will click on the map in the desired location, select the type of recommendation, and add specific notes before saving it to their profile.


In order to use this starter code, you will be responsible for connecting your own database and Google React key. The database should be added on the server.js file while the Google key will need to be added to the map component.

Happy exploring!
